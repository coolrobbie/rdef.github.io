## Intro
Below are my thoughts on pulling together an academic CV, or *curriculum vitae* (*curriculum-vitæ* if you're fancy - note that little a-e ligature at the end), also called a *resume/résumé*. 

If you're just here for some quick guides or samples, then see the [template here](/docs/cv-guide), or view my [workshop sheet here](/assets/files/curriculum-vitae-workshop-1.pdf). You can use these to think about laying out the CV. I've also put together a set of [useful links](/docs/career-dev-links) to other resources.

### Who this is for

This post will be useful for people pulling together their own CV for the first time, whether as a prospective grad student, or someone who hasn't had to think about this question for a while. I'd like to think that this would be useful for anyone thinking about career development more generally. 

### Why listen to me?

My approach is to

* make the CV less anxiety inducing (hopefully);
* develop your understanding of the perspective of your reader;
* avoid the issues of 
* give you a theory of communication for the CV.

The theoretical basis will hopefully help you to avoid making some mistakes as well as giving you a means of working on your CV yourself. By focusing


In terms of experience, I've helped people develop their CV, which have led them to getting their first job. I've sat on hiring panels in the past, as well as sat through training modules and such around employing people, although this isn't all that uncommon. what's probably been more useful in understanding what a CV is and how they work is by helping other people with their career track questions. 

By way of context, I'm writing from the context of Oceania, from within HASS. If you're in a different context, you'll likely benefit from contextualising my template to your situation, however I would say that my ideas are probably worth considering.

## Describing yourself through a CV

The CV is there to communicate your career succinctly to a potential employer - that much is obvious - but you're stuck with the challenge of giving someone you probably don't know a list of tabular data and asking them to make sense of it. Your task is to make your academic work clear to your reader; if it starts to become unclear, or if you try to conceal something (such as present non-peer reviewed material as if it were peer reviewed), then this will muddle your CV, make your career look vague, and 

how can we do that effectively? indicate ability, indicate potential, and indicate understanding. 

### Ability

One thing I would say is don't get too wrapped up

Your curriculum vitae is a document that's supposed to communicate about you to others.

The standard approach, at least in Australia, is to separate your work into your research, teaching, and service. 

The thing about CVs is that they can get quite long.



There’s so much advice out there – use whatever gels with your approach. Very little will be mindblowingly useful, but hopefully some stuff will help.

Here’s the Academic CV that I used when I got my first proper job.

Here are the slides for a cv-writing workshop i ran in 2018.



## My post-PhD CV

Here it is: [**my post-PhD CV**](/assets/files/fordyce-resume-success.pdf).

This is the CV that I was using when I got my first 'proper' (i.e. ongoing) academic role in 2018. There are two things that significantly shape this CV: getting some grants during my PhD and my high volume of sessional teaching. I only mention this because I think that it's worth noting that the CV is from a different time, and I had different opportunities than others. It would be hard for a PhD student today to amass the amount of teaching that I was able to do, and it's worth noting that this is because the university sector had a different economy of operation than it does today. I'd stress that if you are developing a CV for your first academic role today, you're not in competition with my CV from 2018. In fact, today, I've removed most of the sessional teaching from my CV.

#### Grants 

I applied for two grants during my PhD to study 3D printing, and received about AUD 82k. I didn't do this alone, and collaborated primarily with my good friend Luke Heemsbergen on this, as well as receiving some support from senior staff. Through this Luke and I were able to create our own research fellow roles. 

On the one hand this was really useful to allow us to pay ourselves to do research and publish during our PhDs, on the other, we didn't take time out from our PhDs, and it meant that I overran my candidature clock a bit.

#### Sessional teaching

I did a *lot* of sessional teaching, especially over 2016-2018.  This was an odd time for media and communications, over a period with huge increases in student numbers, especially overseas students. In several cases I was given unit coordination duties for subjects that had seen ~30 students the previous year, but would have over 200 in the year I took over.

Teaching in this period was a bit of a wild west situation. It felt at the time like we were expected to already know what to do, which was a daunting feeling. On reflection we were simply left without any guidance or advice simply because it was easier for the staff, or they were oblivious. I would say that I didn't *really* know how to run a unit when I started, and only really learned through trial an error over four years. 

In many cases there needed to be more oversight of what sessional staff (including myself) were doing. Looking back, I think we were out of our depth, and were largely able to do whatever we wanted with little input from ongoing staff. I learned a lot about teaching and presenting, and I think the lack of oversight was probably useful for getting a sense of 'what worked' and 'what didn't' - that said, it would have been far more useful to get guidance and feedback rather than wrangling through it by myself.

I don't list this stuff on my CV anymore, partly because I think that we were doing a lot more than the roles really suggested and partly because most of it isn't really that indicative of how I've developed my teaching in post-COVID period.
