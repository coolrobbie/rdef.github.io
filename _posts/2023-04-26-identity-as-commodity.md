Identity\-as\-commodity
=======================




The below is a response to a question on the commodification of identity that I once addressed on social media.

---


There are a large number of scholars who view identity as a core part of capitalist processes, but few of them are people that would be readily classed as philosophers. This does not invalidate their claims, it simply means we should not treat them as philosophical claims. Many are theories from social theorists, some are well\-grounded, but few are systematically grounded in a satisfying ontology. This may be sufficient for you in terms of your question, which is why I mention them here. I would also note that there is likely a disconnect between philosophical precision around the language of identity that I have had to be loose with; theorists do not always commit to a consistent language, and introduce new definitions regularly. I have published before on the distinction and slippages between persona, identity, and subjectivity, and it is on these grounds that I can give you some insight.


The main starting point for this work is, however, philosophical. Deleuze, working with Guattari in [Anti\-Oedipus](https://www.amazon.com/Anti-Oedipus-Capitalism-Schizophrenia-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143105825), describes several aspects of what you are looking at. Firstly, they note that resistance to capitalism through alternative cultural practices (for instance, Hippies, goths, protest movements, etc) become identities that are recapitulated into capitalism. The productivity of these groups is substantial, and the groups are far more important in terms of their capacity to generate value than they are in terms of their capacity to resist capitalism. Capitalism is, they suggest, more than willing to incorporate its critiques back into itself, simply because they are productive.


Secondly the identification of the Oedipus complex is, they suggest, not a ‘generalised’ phenomena as identified by psychoanalysts of the past. Instead it is an imposed order that is a product of a capitalist society that has led itself to controlling its subjects through (speaking with a shorthand here) an educative process that creates the individual in the “daddy\-mommy\-me triangle”. This is to say, that the Oedipus complex should be understood as a socially produced system for training individuals as productive subjects through mechanisms of desire and guilt. We are born into this model, we learn this model, we reproduce it, we create productive identities in ourselves and in others through this same process. There is much more to this work, and to be honest I have committed the regular social science sin of taking part of D\+G and not the whole.


The following people have some sort of theorisation of the production of identity (usually described as a subjectivity or subject position) in the context of capitalism, in many cases building from D\+G’s ideas, albeit usually without explicitly referring to *Anti\-Oedipus*.


Sarah Banet\-Wiser in [Authentic™](https://nyupress.org/9780814787144/authentic/) makes similar arguments around authenticity and branding, noting that the production of authentic identity is central to the development influencer brands, and that this is simply a highly individuated expression of broader behaviours that brands and corporations had conducted before. Banet\-Wiser notes that this is partly about how feminist movements have an uneasy and complicated relationship to capitalism, given that, to a substantial extent, capitalism is the space where feminism often plays out as a social movement.


Jim McGuigan’s [Cool Capitalism](https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745326788/cool-capitalism/) advances arguments similar to Deleuze and Guattari above, noting that radical art movements have been incorporated into branding throughout the 20th Century, c.f. Frida Kahlo.


Virginia Eubanks, in [Automating Inequality](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250074317/automatinginequality), notes that identity is the source of considerable datafication, often in terms of the idea of culture and practice that I suspect you’re interested in, but also more directly in terms of *financialisation* of identity. That is, literally your ability to draw credit and have employment is increasingly tied to your subject position; your access to welfare, insurance, and housing is often tied to a history of data about your practice as a capitalist subject.


Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri’s [Empire](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674006713) argues that contemporary production has become increasingly abstract in a search for sources of value that resource production itself can no longer sustain. Their work is the most reliant on D\+G in making their claims of those I have mentioned, and they also build from D\+G’s [Mille Plateaux](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/a-thousand-plateaus) in terms of affects and subjectivity. This is something of an inversion of what you’re describing, as they suggest that late capitalism is in the process of designing the resources of subject production, and creates subject positions, but then leaves it to individuals to adapt these into properly formed subjectivities (or identities) that then are harvested again for more value in cultural capitalism.


To take the obverse of all this, and look back to the mid\-20th Century, in [The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life](https://www.amazon.com.au/Presentation-Self-Everyday-Life/dp/0385094027) Erving Goffman actually proposes the importance of a well\-manufactured identity as necessary for success within capitalism. This is closer to a text describing a theory of effective conduct in business than what we would currently identify as the current veins of critical theory, but the general argument is that identity and comportment, and the separation of a private and a public ‘self’ is crucial for being effective within capitalist employment.

Marcuse is probably the notable point to investigate the antithesis of this, although it’s reasonably clear to me that his work does not contradict any of this, merely implies limits. His [One Dimensional Man](https://www.amazon.com.au/One-Dimensional-Man-HERBERT-MARCUSE/dp/0807014176) is one that effectively states that the idea of an individual freedom is only allowed within some relatively strict boundaries of acceptable identity. This freedom he describes is effectively the freedom of a limited range of identities that are productively useful for the societies of modernity (and at this point he is looking at the operations of socialist government in the USSR as well as Western capitalism). I would say that the number of accepted nationalist/fascistic social movements around the globe, combined with the utter resistance to any kind of resistance to fascism does make me feel like there is still a something to Marcuse’s argument here.
