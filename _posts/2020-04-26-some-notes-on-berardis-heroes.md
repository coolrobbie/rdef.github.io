Franco Berardi’s book *[Heroes](https://www.versobooks.com/products/11-heroes)* looks at the sexual/reproductive political aspects of the incel community and its connections to extremist behaviour. The title, Heroes, is an ironic commentary on how these individuals perceive themselves, and the book is clearly from the pre\-Tate period. The work is somewhat anthropological in nature, given its focus on a community in anthropological terms, yet Berardi is not a traditional anthropologist. One consequence of this is that he tends to draw some very long bows with his data. 

Berardi identifies some themes in incel culture (including the way that the incel community is very focused on evolution, heteronormativity, and genetic lines), which are common to many analyses, but I think the uniqueness is to be found in the way he combines these into a political analysis of behaviour. Specifically, he identifies perverse ideas of ‘nature’ shaping evolution in this context in human social settings. The incel community, when unable to reproduce themselves, see their goal as eliminating those that have undesirable traits. This includes those who have sex for pleasure. The incel approach is tautological – it is bad for society because it either produces a society that they see as not being the one they want (we still have societies that are non\-monogamous, and non\-monogamy works well in many animal species), or, alternatively they will rarely engage in murder to make that society suffer random bouts of sex\-based terrorism.
