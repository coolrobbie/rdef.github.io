# A generic CV outline

I've mapped out a pretty basic outline of a CV, with each bullet point being a heading or subheading in your CV. If you find that you don't have anything for a heading or subheading, then remove it. There are other ways of laying this out, but this is likely the easiest way to do it, and you probably have something for each of the top-level sections.

Order each entry in a section by year, with the most recent materials first. I would strongly advise that you have the year flush with the left-hand side in order to make it easy for people to read the frequency and pace of your works.

Try and keep each entry for the CV to no more 3 lines. You just need enough detail to show that you did something real, and maybe provide a very brief note about the entry if it's particularly useful. People reading your CV will mostly not know the specific units you've taught at whichever university, and may not even know the journals you're publishing into. Don't be tempted to give them the full explanation here! Instead, give them enough to contextualise it and if they are really interested you'll be able to discuss it in the interview, or in a social context at another point.
