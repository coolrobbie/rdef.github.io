description: A bunch of useful links for academic career development.

Below are career development resources and links that I've collected over the years. First up are some resources I've created, then detailed resources from other scholars. I've also added a variety of other links to templates and guides for non-CV matters.

# Getting an academic job

[**Tom Apperley's 'how to get a job' videos**](https://www.youtube.com/@tomnz74)
* Tom is a wonderful academic mentor, and taught me pretty much everything I know about academic careers. 
* Tom's YouTube channel has a series of videos on how to get a job. 

[**Jonathan Sternew's academic jobs guide**](https://sterneworks.org/Academe/)
* This is a good set of resources for the academic jobs environment, from Jonathan Sterne.
* [Archived version here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240518222512/https://sterneworks.org/Academe/) in the event the page goes down.

[**The Academic Jobs Wiki**](https://academicjobs.fandom.com/wiki/Academic_Jobs_Wiki)
* This wiki lists a huge number of academic jobs from around the world. 
* The academic jobs wiki will be most useful if you're looking to get out of your current academic environment, especially if you're looking to move overseas. 
* It won't give you the same full picture you'd get on the ground at each instituion, but it will give you *some* perspective.

# CV development
[**Curriculum Vitae Workshop Slides**](/assets/files/curriculum-vitae-workshop-1.pdf)
* These slides go through a top-level understanding of the academic CV from my perspective.
* You can use some sections of this as a template for your own CV.
* Slides are from 2018, updated in 2021.

[**My post-PhD CV**](/assets/files/fordyce-resume-success.pdf)
* This is the CV that I used immediately after completing my PhD.
* See a more detailed discussion of this CV <a href="#my-post-phd-cv">lower on this page</a>.
